# Study Room Face Recognition System

This project aims to utilize Python and OpenCV for facial recognition in an autonomous study room scenario. The system tracks user attendance, records entry and exit times, and calculates the duration of stay using a face recognition system based on computer vision techniques.


## Group Conception

After discussions among group members, we explored various applications of computer vision (CV) in different industries, such as medical image analysis, parking systems, face recognition, and self-checkout systems. We ultimately chose to focus on a study room attendance system using face recognition. This system aims to improve efficiency by reducing manual operations, enhancing accuracy, and improving security by ensuring only registered users can access the study room.


## System Components

1. **Authentication Module**: Allows administrators to log into the system by entering their name and account number.
2. **Face Detection**: Captures real-time input from the camera and detects faces using OpenCV.
3. **Model Training**: Trains the neural network to recognize faces from the collected dataset.
4. **Face Enrollment**: Enrolls faces into the system's database.
5. **Time Record**: Calculates total time spent by each individual and displays the cost.

## Tools Overview

1. **Python**

2. **OpenCV**

3. **TensorFlow**

4. **Keras**

5. **PyQt5**


## UI
